<p>Myself ? I’m just another guy interested in vulnerability research and reverse engineering.
    Because I learned a lot from random posts on internet, and I’m interested by ever
    learning/challenging myself, I decided to create this blog to share back to the community
    and write down my adventures. I do hope some people will find it interesting.</p>
