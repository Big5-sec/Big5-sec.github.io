<p>Welcome to another blog of just another guy interested in vulnerability research and reverse engineering!
    Because I learned a lot from random posts on internet, and Iâ€™m interested by ever
    learning/challenging myself, I decided to create this blog to share back to the community
    and write down my adventures. Let's hope some people will find it interesting!</p>

<p>Within the Blogposts section, you'll find posts containing detailed analyses. Within the Advisories section, you'll find quick details about some of the vulnerabilities I have reported. I indeed believe that documenting and publishing details about vulnerabilities help a lot defenders.</p>

<p>If you have any remark/question/correction to give out, feel free to reach me at the
    following email address: nicolas.zilio@hotmail.fr</p>
