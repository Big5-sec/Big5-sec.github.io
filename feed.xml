      Introduction

When looking for vulnerabilities of interest, it’s always a good option to look for vulnerabilities used at pwn2own. Indeed, these vulnerabilities are exploited during the competition, meaning they indeed have a practical impact. This year, I got my interest piqued during my freetime by a LPE (CVE-2023-29360) reported by Thomas Imbert(@masthoon) for the following reasons:

      Introduction

Microsoft introduced recently a new mitigation in the Windows kernel, dubbed “Component Filter”. The following blog post will explains what this mitigation is about, and how it actually works. Let’s dive in.

The big picture

Before going into the details of this new mitigation, I thought it would be better to present my own view of the aims of this new mitigation, and how it inte...

      Introduction

I wanted to have some fun on patch diffing : on the latest “patch tuesday” update, Microsoft released a patch for an information disclosure vulnerability in the storage spaces controller. This vulnerability has been found by Quang Linh, working at STAR Labs.  Because leaking information is often easier than a full blown RCE/LPE exploit, I selected this vuln because it would take l...

      Short Intro and past references

For a course I teach, I wanted to present the modern mitigations one can encounter on Windows. I focused on those aimed at preventing shellcode execution and ROP, because this course was on stack buffer overflows. Namely, the interesting ones are:


  Stackpivot
  CallerCheck
  SimExec
  Import Address Filtering (IAF)
  Export Address Filtering (EAF)
