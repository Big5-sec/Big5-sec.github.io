<p>Myself ? Iâ€™m just another guy interested in vulnerability research and reverse engineering. Because I learned a lot from random posts on internet, and Iâ€™m interested by ever learning/challenging myself, I decided to create this blog to share back to the community and write down my adventures. I do hope some people will find it interesting.</p>

<p><small>PS : Right now, Iâ€™m open to new remote opportunities related to those fields. Feel free to discuss it.</small></p>
