Myself ? I'm just another guy interested in vulnerability research and reverse engineering. Because I learned a lot from random posts on internet, and I'm interested by ever learning/challenging myself, I decided to create this blog to share back to the community and write down my adventures. I do hope some people will find it interesting.

<small>PS : Right now, I'm open to new remote opportunities related to those fields. Feel free to discuss it.</small>
